\section{Earth Observation platform on-cloud}

In this section, the whole \ac{EO} system integrated in \vw and \bonfire is
detailed. This system is constituted by:
\begin{itemize}
\item A \sss including models of satellite constellation and a ground stations
  network.
\item A cloud computing system that implements a novel architecture that
  integrates an Orchestrator, an archive and catalogue module, an IaaS system
  with image processors to transform the raw data acquired by the satellites and
  transform it into orthorectified images, and finally an archive and catalogue
  module for storing, cataloging and allocating images.
\end{itemize}

The \sss and the entire cloud system are depicted in the following sections.
