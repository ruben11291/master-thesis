\drop{T}{he} obtained results of the implementation, execution and
validation of the GEO-Cloud experiment are explained. The \emph{PlanetLab}
experiment for measuring the network impairments (bandwidth, loss-rate and
\ac{RTT}) are shown and plotted. These plots represent how the impairments
directly depend on the distance between both source and destination elements.
The next section shows the results of the execution of some defined scenarios
the GEO-Cloud experiment. Finally, the evaluation of the system is explained.
