\drop{T}{he} obtained results of the implementation, execution and
validation of the GEO-Cloud experiment are explained. The \emph{PlanetLab}
experiment for measuring the network impairments (bandwidth, loss-rate and
\ac{RTT}) are shown and plotted. These plots represents how the impairments
directly depends on the distance between both source and destination elements.
The next section shows the results of the execution of some defined scenarios into
the GEO-Cloud experiment. Finally, the evaluation of the implementation for processing
\ac{EO} images on-cloud is explained.

\section{PlanetLab Experiment Results}

During the exectuion of the \pl experiment, 21600 communications were
performed between every node rendering the ground stations and end users and the
node representing the cloud. The bandwidth, loss-rate and latency were
measured. The nodes with their obtained values are represented in Table~\{},
where every node are sorted by the distance between the cloud node and it.
The 21600 samples during 6 hours of continous execution are represented in
histrograms for each node.
