\chapter{Implementation in Virtual Wall and BonFIRE}




In this section, the implementation is introduced indicating the testbeds involved in it and the required steps for the implementation.

Then, the implementati is dedicated to the implementation of the\ Space System
Simulator in\ Virtual Wall. Firstly, the new modified topology
(different to the designed one) is depicted because of the handicaps of
the hardware during the implementation. Then, nodes reservation\ is
explained and detailed. Finally, the scripts included in each type of
node are described before the presentation of the execution.


Section 3 is dedicated to the implementation\ of the software
developed\ in the BonFIRE testbed. Nodes reservation is firstly
depicted. Architecture and setup are also explained. And again, the
scripts for each node are included before the description of the
execution.


After the explanation of the implementation, the integration in\ the
testbeds is described in\ sections 4 and 5, relative\ to the
integration of Virtual Wall -- BonFIRE and BonFIRE -- IDV respectively.

Section 6 is devoted\ to\ describe the\ demonstration\ of the\ GEO-Cloud
experiment prepared for the European Commission in June 2014.

Finally, section 7 provides\ the main\ conclusions.
