\section{GEO-Cloud Experiment Results}
\label{sec:geocloud-results}

In this section, the results obtained of the GeoCloud project 

The first results of the Cloud architecture were obtained from the execution of
the both first and second scenarios. The time of processing with the processors
working with images located into their local storage are shown in
Table~\ref{table:results-processing}. In that table can be seen that it is
possible to obtain an orthorectified in 8 minutes moreless.  
Furthermore, the time on delivered the
images after processing was only the transfer time between the Processing Chain
to the Archive and Catalogue module.
