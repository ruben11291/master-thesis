\section{Cloud Architecture}

In this section, the \ac{EO} architecture on cloud is fully described. As
mentioned, the cloud infrastructure where this system is implemented is provided
by \bonfire multi-cloud. The \emph{Orchestrator}, \emph{Archive and Catalogue} and \emph{Processing
Chain} integrate the cloud components for processing, archiving and cataloging
Earth's surface images. This modules are summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Orchestrator:} it manages the automatic distribution of the raw data to the processors. It handles the complete automatic processing chain execution.  If the processor chain is occupied, the manager replicates the complete chain in a new machine.
\item \emph{Processing Chain:} it processes the raw data and converts it in orthorectified images. 
\item \emph{Archive and catalogue:} it is the place where the processed images are stored and catalogued for its distribution.
\end{itemize}

In the following sections, these cloud components are
depicted and the interactions among them are also explained. First, the product
processors compose the \emph{Processing Chain} are shown. These processors are owned
by Elecnor Deimos company, so they are not fully described but the main features
are exposed. Then, the \emph{Archive and Catalogue}
module is described. Finally, the \emph{Orchestrator} component that manages all the
cloud processes is fully explained and detailed.
