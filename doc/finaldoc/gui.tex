\section{GEO-Cloud GUI}

In this section, the \ac{GUI} developed for managing the execution of the defined
scenarios in GEO-Cloud experiment is exposed. First, the architecture is
explained. Then, the components as \emph{ExperimentController}, \emph{Video
  Component} or \emph{Load Plot} among others are described. Finally, the
\ac{GUI} is shown and an example execution step by step is performed.
