\section{GEO-Cloud Graphical User Interface}
\label{sec:interfaz}
In this section, the \ac{GUI} developed for managing the execution of the defined
scenarios in GEO-Cloud experiment is exposed. First, the architecture is
explained. The components of the graphical user interface are described. Then, the interface is shown to identify the components.

\subsection{Architecture}

The graphical user interface of GEO-Cloud experiment is composed by the following classes:

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Experiment Controller}: it manages the \sss turning on or shutting it down by using \ac{SSH} connections and it obtains the workload of the \emph{Orchestrator} and \emph{Processing Chain} machine.
\item \emph{SSH Connection}: it creates an \emph{SSH} connection with a \vw machine.
\item \emph{SSH Order}: it remotely executes an  \emph{SSH} order in a \emph{SSH Connection}.
\item \emph{getLoad}: it obtains the workload of the \emph{Orchestrator} and \emph{Processing Chain} machines.
\item \emph{JFedParser}: it parsers the \emph{Rspec} obtained from the \emph{JFed} software once the \vw deployment was made to obtain the hostnames of the \vw nodes.
\item \emph{UI Controller}: it manages the graphical widgets and the \emph{Experiment Controller} interactions.
\item \emph{Video Widget}: it shows a video demonstration of the satellite constellation acquiring images at same time that the satellites do it in \vw.
\item \emph{About Widget}: it shows the \emph{About} window where the acknowledments are shown.
\item \emph{Log Widget}: it prints the logs which receives from satellites and ground stations.
\item \emph{Tab Widget}: it contains two graphics to plot the workload of the \emph{Orchestrator} and the \emph{Processing Chain} machines.
\end{itemize}

The Figure~\ref{fig:gui-class} shows the class diagram where the relations between the components are pictured.

\subsubsection{Experiment Controller}

The functions of the \emph{Experiment Controller} are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item To obtain the hostnames of the \vw nodes included in the \emph{Rspec} file located in ``source/gui/resources/jfed.out''. It creates a \emph{JFedParser} object to do this. These hostnames are used to create \emph{SSH Connections} objects to send orders to the \vw nodes.
\item To create the \emph{SSH Connections} of all the nodes deployed in \vw.
\item To create the \emph{SSH Commands} to manage the experimentation in \vw.
\item To obtain the workload of both the \emph{Orchestrator} and \emph{Processing Chain} machines. Then, these measures are sent to the \emph{UI Controller} for plotting.
\item To communicate the experiment logs from \vw to the \emph{UI Controller}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Experiment Controller Workflow}~\\

The workflow of the \emph{Experiment Controller} is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The file which contains the \emph{Rspec} is parsed.
\item Using the hostnames obtained, it creates a \emph{SSH Connection} per hostname obtained.
\item When the experimenter selects an scenario and pushes the start button, the \emph{Experiment Controller} creates \emph{SSH Commands} indicating to start the selected scenario and sends to \vw nodes by using the \emph{SSH Connection} objects. Moreover, it starts the reproduction of the video of the selected scenario.
\item When the experimenter selects an scenario and pushes the stop button, the \emph{Experiment Controller} creates \emph{SSH Commands} indicating to stop the selected scenario and sends to \vw nodes by using the \emph{SSH Connection} objects.
\item The log from the \emph{SSH Commands} performed is collected and it sends them to the \emph{UI Controller}.
\item Two \emph{getLoad} objects are created to connect with the \emph{Orchestrator} and the \emph{Processing Chain} machines to obtain in real time their workload by using \emph{SSH Connections}. The workloads are passed to the \emph{UI Controller} for plotting.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{SSH Connection}

This class connects through the \emph{Virtuall Wall Bastion} machine to the \vw nodes. This connection is performed by using the public key obtained in Section~\ref{sec:first-steps}.

\paragraph{getLoad Workflow}~\\

The workflow of the \emph{getLoad} is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The object is created by passing as argument the \ac{IP} address of remote machine.
\item A \emph{SSH Connection} to machine is created.
\item Periodically, it sends a \emph{SSH Order} to get the workload though the \emph{SSH Connection}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{JFedParser}

This class parser the  \emph{Rspec} of the \emph{JFed} to obtain the hostnames of the \vw nodes.

\paragraph{JFedParser Workflow}~\\

The workflow of the \emph{JFedParser} is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The object is created by passing as argument the path of the \emph{Rspec} file.
\item By using a \ac{XML} Python parser (Minidom library) obtains the hostnames of all nodes deployed in \vw.
\item When the operation \emph{getHostnames} is called, the hostnames are returned.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{UI Controller}

The \emph{UI Controller} is based in the \emph{Controller} design pattern and it has the following functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
\item To manage the experiment status through graphical widget interactions and sends them to the \emph{Experiment Controller}.
\item To show the experiment status such as the workload, logs and video from \emph{Experiment Controller}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{UI Controller Workflow}~\\

The workflow of the \emph{UI Controller} is the following:
\begin{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item[>] python main.py
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Components of the Graphical User Interface}

The \acl{GUI} is composed by four well diferenciated elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Video zone}: it is the zone where the video of each scenario is reproduced.
\item \emph{Log zone}: it is the zone where the logs are shown during the experiment.
\item \emph{Workload zone}: it is the zone where the workloads of the \emph{Orchestrator} and the \emph{Processing Chain} machines are shown.
\item \emph{User interaction zone}: it is the zone where the experimenter selects the scenario and manages the experiment.
\end{itemize}
