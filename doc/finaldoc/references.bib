  title = {Space Satellites from The World’s Garage, The Story of AMSAT},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON)},
  year = {1994},
  abstract = {AMSAT is a worldwide group of Amateur Radio Operators (Hams) who share
	an active interest in building, launching and then communicating
	with each other through non-commercial Amateur Radio satellites.
	By any measure, AMSAT's track record has been impressive. Since its
	founding 25 years ago, AMSAT has used predominantly volunteer labor
	and donated resources to design, construct, and, with the added assistance
	of international government and commercial agencies, successfully
	launch, over 30 Amateur Radio satellites into Earth orbit. Today,
	almost 20 of these satellites are operational.
	
	
	The Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation (as AMSAT is officially known)
	was formed in 1969 as a not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) educational organization
	chartered in the District of Columbia. Its aim is to foster Amateur
	Radio's participation in space research and communication. Since
	that time, other like-minded groups throughout the world have formed
	to pursue the same goals. Many of these groups share the "AMSAT"
	name. While the affiliations between the various groups are not formal,
	they do cooperate very closely with one another. For example, international
	teams of AMSAT volunteers are often formed to help build each other's
	space hardware, or to help launch and control each other's satellites.
	
	
	Since the very first OSCAR satellites (OSCAR stands for Orbiting Satellite
	Carrying Amateur Radio) were launched in the early 1960s, AMSAT's
	international volunteers, often working quite literally in their
	basements and garages, have pioneered a wide variety of new communications
	technologies that are now taken for granted in the world's satellite
	marketplace. These breakthroughs have included some of the very first
	satellite voice transponders as well as highly advanced digital "store-and-forward"
	messaging transponder techniques. All of these accomplishments have
	been achieved through close cooperation with international space
	agencies which often have provided launch opportunities at significantly
	reduced costs in return for AMSAT's technical assistance in developing
	new ways to launch paying customers. Spacecraft design, development
	and construction has also occurred in a fiscal environment of individual
	AMSAT member donations, thousands of hours of volunteer effort, and
	the creative use of leftover materials donated from aerospace industries
	worldwide.
	
	
	This paper will focus on some of the creative technical and managerial
	techniques that AMSAT has used to work with donated resources and
	international teams of volunteer talent to design, build and launch
	commercial grade communications satellites in a not-for-profit environment.
	We believe some of these techniques may also have application in
	"for profit" and government space activities. Our goal is to offer
	these techniques as suggestions to individuals, corporations and
	other agencies now searching for significantly lower cost access
	to space.},

	ii) On demand storage, processing and distribution of geoinformation

	Conventional infrastructures have the risks of over/under size the

	to provide highly demanding EO services by using future internet

  month = {June},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {The Obama Administration is acting on its recognition that climate
	change is a defining issue of our generation. Our responses to the
	challenges of climate change—accurate prediction, equitable adaptation,
	and efficient mitigation—will influence the quality of life for the
	nation, and indeed the world, for generations to come. The President’s
	FY2011 budget request provides a cumulative \$10.3 Billion (B) funding
	to NASA’s Earth Science program over the period FY2011–2015 to address
	pressing scientific and national issues associated with climate change
	and the nation’s climate research and monitoring capabilities. As
	recommended by the National Research Council’s (NRC’s) Earth Science
	and Applications Decadal Survey, this FY2011 budget request returns
	NASA Earth Science funding to the approximate level that it had in
	FY2000, an increase of more than 30% from recent levels. This funding
	allows for the acceleration and expansion of activities across the
	entire, coordinated Earth Science program—in the areas of flight
	missions, research, applications, and Earth Science mission technology
	development—thus advancing the balance and scope that have been hallmarks
	of NASA Earth System Science. This document outlines the integrated
	NASA Earth Science program enabled by the FY2011 budget request.
	
	The integrated and balanced program described here is aligned with
	the Administration’s overarching emphasis on climate research and
	monitoring. It is further consistent with, and has been informed
	by, the comprehensive vision for NASA’s Earth Science endeavor set
	forth by the NRC in its Decadal Survey. Most visibly, this architecture
	revitalizes the nation’s research satellite system, providing near-term
	measurements to advance science, underpin policy, and expand applications
	and societal benefits. In addition to building the Orbiting Carbon
	Observatory-2 mission for launch in 2013, NASA will: accelerate development
	of the four NRC Decadal Survey Tier 1 missions so that they are all
	launched by 2017; accelerate and expand the Venture-class line of
	competed, innovative small missions; initiate new space missions
	to address continuity of high-priority climate observations; and
	bring two Decadal Survey Tier 2 missions forward to allow launch
	by 2020.
	
	Complementing the flight portfolio expansion, NASA will advance climate
	research, multiply applications using the full set of available (NASA
	and non-NASA) satellite measurements for direct societal benefit,
	and develop/mature technologies required for the next generations
	of Earth observing missions. These non-flight activities, which are
	essential for transforming the global spaceborne measurements into
	accurate predictions, efficient information products for the broad
	range of end-users, and consistent bases for long-term monitoring,
	include (but are not limited to): modeling and assessments supporting
	National Assessments and future IPCC studies; acceleration of operational
	use of NASA research products for predictions, building on expertise
	developed with systems such as SERVIR; focused calibration activities
	to effectively leverage measurements from international space missions
	and in-situ observations; development and testing of aspects of a
	national carbon monitoring system serving science, policy-makers,
	and stakeholders; and investments in effective Earth Science education
	programs such as GLOBE.
	
	With this plan, NASA’s Earth Science program will substantially advance
	science, expand applications, and address national information requirements
	for near-term policy development and future evaluations of policy
	efficacy.
	
	To present the next level of detail, the work to be accomplished with
	FY2011 President’s Budget Request is described in the categories
	of Space-based Observing Systems; Mission-enabling/Data Exploiting
	Research and Applications; and Assembling the Components to Meet
	National Needs.},

	challenge: the treatment of massive and large-sized data obtained
	from Earth Observation satellite recordings. Remote sensing industries
	implement on-site conventional infrastructures to acquire, store,
	process and distribute the geo-information generated. However these
	solutions do not cover sudden changes in the demand of services and
	the access to the information presents large latencies.
	
	The current demand of services has traditionally been driven through
	Spatial Data Infrastructures and heavy standards (ISO TC/211 and
	OGC), which are focused on interoperability rather than the real
	demand from the end-users.
	
	In this work we present the detailed design and implementation of
	an experiment within the FP7 Fed4FIRE project (project number 318389)
	to value if future internet technologies can be used to overcome
	the previously defined limitations.
	
	The scenario is that of a constellation of 17 small satellites equally
	spaced in a Sun-Synchronous Low Earth Orbit at 646km altitude that
	covers the Earth’s surface in a daily basis at 6.7m GSD acquiring
	over 20TB of data per day, around 150000 high resolution images of
	the Earth per month to provide high added value services. All the
	geo-data is daily downloaded in a network of 12 ground stations distributed
	around the world and connected to the BonFIRE cloud for its processing,
	storage and distribution to end users.
	
	A simulator is designed for emulating the constellation of satellites
	and the network of ground stations. It is implemented in the Virtual
	Wall European infrastructure and connected to the BonFIRE cloud.
	There, an architecture is designed for the processing, storage and
	distribution of the received data. The archive, catalogue and web
	services are implemented with the open-source software GEO-Server.
	The impairments of the network between Virtual Wall and BonFIRE are
	measured with a specific experiment in PlanetLab Europe and PlanetLab
	Central.
	
	The whole system implements a complete highly demanding Earth Observation
	system making use of future internet technology and cloud computing
	to define a framework to make Earth Observation industry more competitive
	and adaptable to the new requirements of massive data processing
	and instant access to satellite information."},

	in the 21st century of data
	
	intensity, computing intensity, concurrent access intensity and spatiotemporal
	intensity. These challenges
	
	require the readiness of a computing infrastructure in many capacities
	that can: a) better support discovery,
	
	access, and utilization of data and data processing so as to relieve
	scientists and engineers of IT tasks and
	
	focus on scientific discoveries, b) provision real-time IT resources
	to enable real-time applications, such as
	
	emergency response, c) deal with access spikes, and d) provide more
	reliable and scalable service for massive

	how cloud computing could enable geospatial sciences and how spatiotemporal
	principles, the kernel of
	
	geospatial sciences, could be utilized to ensure the benefits of cloud

	presented to analyze how to: a) search, access, and utilize large
	volumes of geospatial data, b) configure
	
	computing infrastructure for enabling the computability of intensive
	simulation models, c) disseminate and
	
	utilize research results for massive concurrent users, and d) adopt
	spatiotemporal principles to support
