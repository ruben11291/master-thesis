\subsection{Conclusions}
In this document the part of the GEO-Cloud experiment executed in PlanetLab is presented. Topology networks have been created in two layers to simulate the communications between the ground stations and the cloud infrastructure and between such a cloud infrastructure with end users around the world accessing web services computed in cloud. The experiment consists of measuring the real network impairments (effective bandwidth, latency and loss rate) to obtain an approach for its later implementation in the complete Earth Observation system simulator implemented in Virtual Wall and BonFIRE.
