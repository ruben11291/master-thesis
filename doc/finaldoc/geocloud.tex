\label{chap:geocloud-experiment}
The GEO-Cloud experiment consists of the emulation of a realistic and complete Earth Observation System that provides services using cloud technology. For that purpose a constellation of satellites, ground stations, a cloud architecture, use cases and end users' models are designed.

The \ac{EO} system will be computed and emulated in \emph{Fed4FIRE}: A constellation of satellites record images of the Earth in a daily basis. The images are transferred to ground stations that ingest the data into a cloud computing infrastructure. The data is processed and distributed to end users.

The GEO-Cloud experiment is tested in three testbeds: \vw,\bonfire and
\pl. GEO-Cloud is divided into two sub-experiments:
\begin{itemize}
\item One experiment in a system integrated in \vw and \bonfire.
\item One experiment in \pl.
\end{itemize}

The experiment in \vw and \bonfire emulates the whole \ac{EO} system. The system is constituted by:

\begin{itemize}
\item A \sss including models of satellite constellation and a ground stations
  network.
\item A cloud computing system that implements a novel architecture that
  integrates an \emph{Orchestrator}, , an \emph{Processing Chain} component
  based on\ac{EaaS}  with image processors to transform the raw data acquired by the satellites and
  transform it into orthorectified images, and finally an \emph{Archive and Catalogue}
  module for storing, cataloging and allocating images.
\end{itemize}

The experiment in \pl consists of the emulation of the networks that constitute
the links between the ground stations to the cloud and from the cloud to the end
users. There, the network performance, features, bandwidth and impairments are
monitored and measured. Those parameters once measured are used to update the
models implemented in \vw, i.e, bandwidth, latency and loss-rate.

In the next sections, the detailed design of the GEO-Cloud experiment is fully described.
