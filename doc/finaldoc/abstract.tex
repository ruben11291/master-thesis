\chapter{Abstract}

\drop{P}{rocessing} and distribution of big space data still present a critical
challenge: the treatment of massive and large-sized data obtained from \acf{EO}
satellite recordings. Remote sensing industries implement on-site conventional
infrastructures to acquire, store, process and distribute the geo-information
generated. However these solutions do not cover sudden changes in the demand of
services and the access to the information presents large latencies.


In this work we present the detailed design, architecture and implementation of
the GEO-Cloud experiment to value if future internet technologies can be used to
overcome the previously defined limitations. 



The whole system implements a complete highly demanding \acs{EO} system making use of future internet technology and cloud computing to define a framework to make \acs{EO} industry more competitive and adaptable to the new requirements of massive data processing and instant access to satellite information.
